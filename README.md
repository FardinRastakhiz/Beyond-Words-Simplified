# Beyond-Words-Simplified
## Notes:
 - Please install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file before running the program.
 - First time you want to run `data_manager = AGGraphDataModule(..` set the argument `load_preprocessed_data` to `False` to create graphs from texts, But if you have the texts' graphs you can set it to `True` to load them from this directory: `data\GraphData\AG\seq_gen`
